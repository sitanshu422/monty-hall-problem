The Monty Hall Problem is like this:

The show has three doors. A prize like a car or vacation is behind a door, and the other two doors hide a worthless prize called a Zonk; in most discussions of the problem, the Zonk is a goat.
The competitor chooses a door. Weâ€™ll assume that the entrant has no internal knowledge of which gate is holding the prize, so the entrant will simply make a random choice.
Smiling host Monty Hall opens one of the other doors, always choosing the one that shows a goat, and always offers the contestant a chance to change their choice for the remaining unopened door.
The competitor chooses to change the gate or chooses to stick to the first choice.
